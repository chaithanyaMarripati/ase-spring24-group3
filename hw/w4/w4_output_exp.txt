does SMO do better than the random baselines (see prints 1,2,4)?
Yes, SMO does better than the random baselines (prints 1, 2, and 4) 
The average values of the prints 1, 2, and 4 
Average Print1 : 3040.52
Average Print2 : 3021.06
Average Print4 : 3019.99
Average Print5 : 2133.81
Average Print6 : 2332.72
The values of the column Lbs- for these prints range form 1700 - 4000 whereas the range for the prints 5 and 6 
being less variant than the prints 1,2,4 and has less average compared although in print 6 there are cases 
when few values deviate becoming close to heaven.

how many y row evaluations are required for print 3?
To determine the best y value, the code iterates through all rows, 
evaluating them based on the "distance to heaven" metric (d2h). 
Therefore, the number of evaluations required is equivalent to the total number of rows, which is 398.

how does SMO do compared to absolute best (print 3)?
The print 3 (absolute best) has values [2130, 24.6, 40] which are close to print where values are around the 
similar range as of for the print 6 there are values for Lbs- column to have more than 2600 sometimes. 
So, by this we can say print 5 is less variant compared to print 6
