#### observation :

Accuracy varies between 74% to 85%. These values are for soybean dataset. Maximum accuracy is seen when m=1.
Theres is a downward trend as m increases.
it decreases as m increases (except m=0). Different values of k give same accuracy for m=1.

### conclusion :

Setting 'm' to be 1 and anyvalue of k would give us the best acccuracy
